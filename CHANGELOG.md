### Deprecated

### Security

## [3.0.0] - 2026-08-09

- TAG: [v3.0.0][3.0.0t]
- COVERAGE: 98.11% -- 104/106 lines in 5 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 81.82% -- 18/22 branches in 5 files
- 40.62% documented

### Added

- kettle-jem-template-20260720-005 - README Support & Community links now
  include RubyForum.
- kettle-jem-template-20260726-001 - Projects now include YARD lint
  configuration and documentation dependencies so documentation issues fail
  before generated docs are refreshed.
- kettle-jem-template-20260727-001 - Spec harness documentation now lists the
  RSpec helpers provided by `kettle-test`.

### Changed

- kettle-jem-template-20260716-002 - Gemspecs now ship fewer repository-only
  files, reducing package noise for downstream packagers.
- kettle-jem-template-20260720-002 - Development Gemfiles now use the released
  `tree_sitter_language_pack` gem 1.13.3 or newer by default.
- kettle-jem-template-20260725-002 - Version specs now use `anonymous_loader` to
  cover `version.rb` without redefining constants, or are removed when version
  specs are not managed for the project.
- kettle-jem-template-20260728-001 - Generated Ruby workflows now use clearer
  setup-ruby-flash planning and can prepare appraisal-only jobs without
  installing the main Gemfile bundle.
- kettle-jem-template-20260801-001 - Generated README gem dashboard links now
  use ClickGems instead of BestGems.

- Raise the supported Ruby version to 3.1 and align the Active Support logger dependencies with the 3.0 release.

### Fixed

- kettle-jem-template-20260720-003 - StructuredMerge Git diff driver config now
  uses the installed `smorg-rb` driver command.
- kettle-jem-template-20260725-001 - Release pull request branches beginning
  with `feature/release` now run JRuby and TruffleRuby workflows.
- kettle-jem-template-20260726-002 - Generated version files now document their
  version namespace and constants, reducing warning-only YARD lint output.
- kettle-jem-template-20260726-003 - Coverage upload steps now treat Coveralls,
  QLTY, and Codecov as optional, so provider outages do not fail CI when local
  coverage thresholds still pass.
- kettle-jem-template-20260728-002 - Generated RuboCop configs now ignore the
  same `gemfiles/vendor/bundle` tree as `.gitignore`, so vendored dependency
  installs are not reported as project lint debt.
- kettle-jem-template-20260728-005 - VersionGem bootstrap now creates the
  missing canonical version spec when a project only has shim namespace version
  specs.
- kettle-jem-template-20260730-001 - Gemspec package file enumeration now runs
  relative to the gemspec directory, so release package contents stay correct
  even when the gemspec is loaded from another working directory.
- kettle-jem-template-20260801-002 - Generated RSpec helpers now normalize
  managed configuration block bindings structurally, preventing mixed block
  parameter names from producing invalid configuration after a merge.
- kettle-jem-template-20260801-003 - Generated project metadata and
  documentation now normalize configured underscore hostnames to valid
  hyphenated hostnames.
- kettle-jem-template-20260801-004 - Generated organization README logos now
  use GitHub's stable organization avatar endpoint instead of assuming a
  matching Galtzo-hosted asset exists.
- kettle-jem-template-20260802-001 - Devcontainer JSON files now merge as JSONC,
  preserving comments and trailing commas during template updates.

- kettle-jem-template-20260728-003 - Generated dep-heads workflows now run
  TruffleRuby jobs with current RubyGems and Bundler, avoiding setup failures
  before the test suite starts.
- kettle-jem-template-20260728-004 - Generated dep-heads workflows now use the
  setup-ruby Bundler install path for direct appraisal Gemfiles, avoiding rv
  lockfile parser failures on Git and path dependencies.
- kettle-jem-template-20260729-001 - Generated JRuby 9.4 workflows now use the
  legacy manual bundle install path, avoiding setup-time Bundler full-index
  failures against `gem.coop`.

- Fix cross-gem README Markdown references before release.

- Synchronize LICENSE copyright years with README.md for release validation.

- Refresh generated appraisal and coverage/style harness files for CI.

- Restore cross-gem README links for the Active Support logging family.

- Move gemspec version loading out of the Active Support tagged logging module hierarchy.
